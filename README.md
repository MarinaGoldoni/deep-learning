## Deep Learning Exercises

### Description
This repository contains challenges and exercises related to Deep Learning created for learning purposes.

### Repository Structure
The repository consists of two notebooks:

#### 1. Sequence Classification
In this challenge, the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) will be used to create a model for classifying movie reviews as positive or negative with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). To achieve that we used TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
- Dataset used: IMDb

#### 2. Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network
In this notebook a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is implement and trained using the CIFAR dataset. The aim is to have a GAN capable of generating realistic images that closely resemble those in the dataset.
- Dataset used: CIFAR-10
- Output genereted: ![CIFAR GIF](https://i.imgur.com/b2zPnQq.gif)
